# Dialogue Acts
## Examples

We recover some examples for each tag produced by the dialogue act tagger. For each tag, we selected a few utterances where the system was most confident. Confidence was measured using the posterior probability for tag (i.e., P(tag | utterance)). Here are the results.

   Speaker: Interviewee
   Confidence: 0.958952

		Interviewer: "But it's just that if you're able to kind
					  of keep your kid - basically if as time 
					  goes on you can figure that out it's
					  a good ______ because you're heading off
					  trouble at the pass. Then you're not feeling
					  like oh, my God, I asked you one million times.

					  You know you kind of have her involved. 

					  And then you know it's less frustration for you too. 

					  On this next one is relationship quality.

					  When I'm watching you guys I'm watching how in
					  sync you are. How you seem to get along. 

 					  You know if you follow her and if she follows you,
					  you know kind of thing. 

					  Does that make sense?"

		Interviewee: "Uh-huh. "

		Interviewer: "You know if you guys talk back and forth in a fairly
					  regular way, rhythmically. 

					  And it's in the yellow here because I did see you 
					  guys struggle. 

					  You know and I think that that just follows along with
					  what we're saying. "

   Speaker: Interviewee
   Confidence: 0.958809

		Interviewer: "So this might get you know worse for a little bit.

					  But again, you know this is tied in with other stuff.

					  Like some of these other things if we were to work on
					   them and they got better for you and then these got 
					   better for you, this would get better. 

					   Does that make sense? "

		Interviewee: "Uh-huh. "

		Interviewer: "It's all tied together. 

					  This next one is emotional wellbeing. 

					  And even though you have you know daily 
					  hassles down here, you do indicate that things are okay. 

					  You know for the most part it's in the green. 

					  You know future looks okay to you. 

					  You're sleeping okay. "

		Christina: "Yeah, I mean, he'll do that once in a while.
					
					Not any - a problem. I mean, but he'll do it once in
					 a great while. He'll, you know, he'll throw his little
					 fit and then he'll hit me to get my attention. 

					You know, he tries to get his attention, so."

### Statement
1. File: ESC413A2FB#20
   Speaker: Interviewer
   Confidence: 1.0

		Interviewer: "Okay.

					  That was very good because I saw also in the _____ that 
					  he – when you were busy, he was playing by himself.

					  Very good.
					 
					  So what you tell me, yeah it really _____ with the video.
					 
					  Okay.
					 
					  Do you have any questions about the assessment? No? Okay.
					 
					  So this is a child and family profile.
					 
					  We have different areas, and we got all these different areas
					  from research.
					 
					  That tells that the child – research tells us that if the child
					  presents some of the problems in an early age, they’re likely 
					  to present that gene as you grow older.
					 
					  If he presents some behavior problems at the age of two, he 
					  would probably have some behavior problems at five.
					 
					  Not necessarily, but he might have it.
					 
					  So we looked at just seeing how things are going, what’s the
					  strength of your family, things that need a little bit more
					  attention.
					 
					  So this one’s _____ the ______ of child, so that’s based in your
					  report of him, how you see him.
					 
					  First one is child temperament, is how he’s willing to wait for
					  things, how he likes things.
					 
					  Basically his temperament.
					 
					  If he can wait for things, what his reaction when he has to wait
					  for things, when he doesn’t get things or he gets things the way
					  he wanted.
					 
					  So that talks about that."
		

2. File: ESC413A2FB#36
   Speaker: Interviewer
   Confidence: 1.0

		Interviewer: "You also told me last week that he’s kind of stubborn and
					  he can be – he’s okay. 

					  Most of the time he’s fine doing his activities and everything, 
					  but he can become very angry and upset when things doesn’t go
					  the way he’s – so I noticed, in comparison to other kids, that 
					  he’s a very adventurous kid. 

					  Like you told me, sometimes you go to the park and you know he’s
					  not supposed to climb big things and you’re scared that he’s 
					  gonna fall down and maybe hurt himself, and that _____ that in 
					  the video and also from what you told me, that he’s really not 
					  scared of doing things. 

					  He likes trying new things. 

					  Do you think that – and that is something that – see, it’s not all
					  the way here in green and it’s not all the way there in yellow, but
					  that is something that sometimes he can become very hard for you to
					  _____, so it’s something that may need just a little bit more of 
					  attention. 

					  But I think you’re doing a great job, ‘cause you already talked 
					  with me about learning to make you see that you _____. 

					  Do you agree with that?"

		
3. File: ESC413A2FB#230
   Speaker: Interviewee
   Confidence: 1.0

		Interviewee: "That’s fine.

					  I mean, I feel – I’m the type of person, I could get along with 
					  the worst people in the world.

					  I could function with any type of person there is.

					  That’s just me.

					  I mean, I just don’t.

					  If they wanna come knock on my door, talk with me, tell me what’s
					  going on, that’s fine, but as far as me just – they put a letter
					  on the door and me going to see what it’s all about, no.

					  I’m not interested about what goes on over here. All I’m 
					  interested about is working, trying to take care of Austin,
					  get the bills taken care of. 

					  I just live over here.

					  It’d be no different if I lived in a house. 

					  This is just where I live at, but this is not me.

					  What these people do, what goes on in this neighborhood, this is
					  not me."
